108 days till we officially become a “full time travel family”. Augh!! You know it actually sounds close when you see that there are 115 dishwasher tabs in the new container that you get from Costco. *(If we run the dishwasher approximately once a day, we will have 7 tabs leftover….Should I even buy the large package of Chia seeds? Will we finish it up in time before we leave?)*



These are some of the thoughts running through my head as I ran around Costco with my cart brimming full of our two weeks worth of groceries today. I seriously cannot believe this dream that we have talked about for almost a year has become a reality! We have told the family, we have announced it to Mr. Minimalist’s work, and we have told our landlord! It’s seriously going to happen!



But what happens between deciding to full time travel and then arriving in Thailand with your precious belongings in a backpack? There are so many amazing youtubers, vloggers and bloggers who happily announce, “We sold everything and moved to Bangkok!” Hold it right there. Stop the video. Can someone explain to me what “selling everything” actually looks like? I have googled “how to sell everything and full time travel” but I have yet to find a real, down to earth, open and raw blog that spills all the juicy details of what that means!



## Here is my plan!



On this blog, I will share what happens between deciding to Full Time Travel and when we are actually skipping around the world! The Good, the Bad but hopefully not anything Ugly… (Have you seen that movie? Not my favorite my husband loved it so I endured…. ) This blog is going to be a semi-personal diary style blog (without any drama).....(or maybe just a little…) where I will share our journey with you, Dear Reader, and I expect and genuinely hope for fun comments and questions to continue each post! Be kind and gracious as these adventures are dear to my heart.



So Monday night, December 14, 2020.



## **Who are we, and what are we going to do?**



Let me catch you up quickly so we can get some current info on here!



Mr. Minimalist and I have decided to full time travel, starting April 1, 2021. We have 4 beautiful children, 2 girls and 2 boys, (ages 6, 4, 2 and 1) that are just as excited to launch into the world of traveling as we are! We currently live in Phoenix, Arizona but are both originally from Ohio. Throughout our 9 years of marriage, we have lived in Ohio, North Carolina, Utah, South Carolina and now Arizona. That is 8 times moving, whilst adding 4 children in there somewhere. I guess you could say we have had the travel bug for years but didn’t realize it until the sloooooooow summer of 2020. During this past summer, we have both decided that to see the world, to share in different cultures, experience life outside of our little bubble and everything that comes with that is something we are wanting to teach our children.



*Will it be hard? Will we regret our quiet life here in our 2600 sq. ft. rental home? Will I miss my instant pot and favorite spatula? Will I miss Costco?? Or will I never want to be a suburban housewife again?*\
\
All these questions and more have been talked about, prayed about, wondered about, but in the end, we have a strong peace that we are doing exactly what we should be doing. Pray for us, wish us luck and be watching out for radical pictures from around the world!



(Whew!! First blog post done! Time for some Survivor.)
