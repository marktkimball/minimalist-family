As I sit here by the dying embers of our fire, listening to the sound of the dishwasher happily cleaning my dishes for me, I am positively reflecting back on my busy day. From doing a challenging yoga class, to running 2 miles without stopping, to running around the house collecting stuff that we won’t be bringing with us and finally thinking back about painting my toenails red.



The girls and I had some special time this morning fixing their hair and painting not only their nails but toenails too! They each painstakingly spent 5 minutes deciding what color combinations they should do and came up with some unique pink and red patterns. :) I mean, it’s Wednesday in 2020. Why shouldn’t we get all fancy? It might be a normal laundry day around here, but we will look fancy folding those towels!



I have actually purposely not been painting my toe nails in an effort to learn how to do without nail polish when I am traveling. *“If I pack nail polish, I will have to pack nail polish AND remover AND cotton pads.”* It’s like If You Give A Mouse A Cookie….my backpack would be quickly stuffed! So I have stared at my blank nails dismally, but tried to remind myself that I was a minimalist and didn’t have to have nail polish.

 But when my girls happily asked me what color I was going to have today, I smiled back and quickly grabbed up the bright red and slapped it on my toes. And it looked amazing!! I literally have smiled all day looking at my gorgeous red nails. *“Why had it taken me weeks to re-paint my nails??”*



Many people **think** that being a Minimalist means that **you have zero stuff.**

* That you live out of a tiny backpack
* Have only 1 spork
* Your 1 coffee mug doubles as your only bowl?
* You Own exactly 1 set of clothing….the ones on your back.
* Your clothes are black and shapeless



## **This simply is not true.**



From my personal journey, I have learned **what Minimalism is:**

* Living intentionally.
* Being mindful of the things that you have.
* Being careful with your purchases
* Not buying as a hobby
* Saying Goodbye to Excess
* Thinking Outside of the Box
* Being ok with not being “normal”



All of these thoughts and many more all come together in a little package called “minimalism”. (Seriously, as much as I adore the word, it is hard to type!!) It doesn’t mean never owning anything ever again. It doesn’t mean you can’t happily enjoy a shopping experience. It doesn’t mean looking down on others who enjoy Christmas decorations. And it certainly doesn’t mean never owning nail polish.



So to all the minimalists out there, I say:



## **“Paint your toenails RED!”**
