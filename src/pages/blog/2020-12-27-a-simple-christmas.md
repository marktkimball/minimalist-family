## **Experiment:**



Can you have a special Christmas without stockings, a tree, decorations and a bundle of presents?





<br/><br/>

As I sit here in my happy, clean and sunny bedroom typing away on my computer, I am listening to the sounds of the house: the steady hum and bang of the dryer, the waterfall sound machine noise on the baby monitor, and the excited voices of the children challenging their Daddy to a new Christmas game. (What has claws, is blue, and swims in the ocean?)



# **Research:**



I have been looking forward to this Christmas blog post for a couple of weeks now and I am excited to finally write it! Approaching birthdays and Christmas a couple of months ago, we decided to take the focus off of gifts and instead focus on experience and family. And it has been great!! We both grew up in traditional families with mega birthdays and holidays, tons of gifts and huge stockings, and we both loved it!! But thinking of how I wanted to raise my own children in a materialistic culture, I really wanted our children to see that holidays were special for family and experience and didn’t have to be special only because of gifts. Don’t get me wrong, I love a special present and adore giving out gifts too. But if Christmas is supposed to be celebrating the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ, why do we make it so centered on us instead?

Back in November, we had a garage sale and actually made the decision to sell all our Christmas decor AND Christmas tree!! Knowing we wouldn’t be able to take all our stuff with us on our travels in the spring, we knew that Christmas decorations would be a big hit at a garage sale in the fall. And it was! People quickly snatched up all our lights, ornaments, tree, multiple wreaths, and white fluffy woodland animals. We had 9 tubs of decorations!! Letting go of it all was exhilarating and heart breaking at the same time. The children didn’t even remember all the stuff we kept pulling out of tubs but happily set up their own little tables to sell their ornaments. (I did let the girls each keep a special ornament that they weren’t ready to part with yet.) But it was sad for me to see all our decorations disappear and wondering what would be the change in the coming season?



## **Hypothesis:**



But with our Christmas decor gone, what would our simple Christmas look like this year? As with the theme of 2020, why not mix things up and not even decorate? Surprisingly, all the family was totally on board with it, and we had a beautiful and festive season despite the white furry creatures not decorating the mantle place. We still listened to Christmas music non-stop (since August actually!!) and cut out snowflakes, drew Christmas trees and read Christmas stories. Our neighborhood really goes all out with outside Christmas lights, so taking chilly walks in the evenings was fun to look at all the giant inflatable snowmen, Rudolphs and Santas bobbing in the wind. The children loved checking on the inflatable Chewbacca and Yoda to see who got knocked down by a light saber (blown over by the wind).

## **Data/Analysis:**

In lieu of lots of presents for the family, we booked two nights at our nearby Great Wolf Lodge, (an outdoor themed resort with a huge indoor water park) and surprised the children with the news a couple of days before Christmas. And I can happily say that no one missed the presents on Christmas morning as we all swam, laughed and napped our way through the days around Christmas. Getting to spend such quality time with each child while we splashed through the water park was so special to me, I wouldn’t trade a whole stocking full of make up for it.

 Kai (our 15 month old) really blossomed on this little trip, grabbing my hand confidently and steering me around the splash pad wherever he wanted to go. It was so fun to hear him yell out “Mom! Mom! Mom!” when he wanted me to take him to the deeper water. And he even learned a new word, “MEEEE!” in answer to “who is ready to go swimming again?”. Percy ( almost 3 yrs old) loved the huge water slide and begged to go again the second we landed at the bottom together inside our inner tube. “I want to go on the big blue slide again!” (It was 101 steps to the top so I can definitely say we stayed fit on this vacation!)



I did buy each of the children their travel backpack that we have talked about for months, so they were SO shocked to see a present on the couch when they woke up on Christmas morning. Time will tell if they are great for traveling but they all fit them perfectly!  When the girls and I read the American Girl Series, Josephina, they were super excited to try the Mexican tradition of putting out their shoes for the Wise Men to bring them little treats. So they each got a little bag of candy under the shoes on Christmas morning. (Talk about a fun breakfast!)

For the past 3 years, we have surprised Mark with a Christmas performance that the children act out for him. This year, the girls memorized The Night Before Christmas, Luke 2:8-14 and sang him a rousing rendition of “Go Tell it On the Mountain”. Percy knew all the words but decided that performing them was optional, despite my desperate pleading to perform it for Daddy….Oh well. Maybe Broadway isn’t his dream job. When Mark returned to our hotel room with Christmas coffee for us, the children quickly sat him down on the couch and gave him the sweetest present he could want, a darling Christmas performance just for him! He loved it and was so impressed that we had been secretly working on it since October and he never heard us once, despite the fact that he works from home! Mission Accomplished. I had no idea how long The Night Before Christmas actually was when we first started memorizing it together so I was very proud of the girls for happily performing the whole thing for their Daddy! So cute!



## **Conclusion:**

Is it possible to have a fun and special Christmas day without the focus on presents? YES!! I am happy to say that our first minimalistic approach to Christmas was a huge success. Was it perfect? No, not at all. The boys got freezing in the water park with purple lips, shaking arms and ended up wrapped in towels while we cheered on the girls as they rode the slides. Was there fighting back at home with gifts from relatives? Yes. Was it chaotic at times? Yes. Was it hard to cook in a hotel room without a microwave due to Covid? Yes. (COLD black bean burgers and french fries anyone?) But was it special without a tree and a decorated roof? Absolutely!! Will I continue to trade material gifts for a family experience? YES!!



Merry Christmas to you and your family!
