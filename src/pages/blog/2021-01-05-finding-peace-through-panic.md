Anyone else excited for the NEW YEAR!!?? Oh man, I am. Not only does a new year mean resolutions, goals and new dreams, but I am actually excited about writing the number #21! It has been my favorite number since I was 12 years old in Kentucky, where I was assigned the jersey number on my jr. varsity volleyball team. It’s been a happy number relationship ever since. So getting to write it all year long? Sign me up!!

**So where are we at with all our travel planning?**

<br/>

“Hey Siri, how many days till April 1?”

“It’s eight-six days from now.”



Thank you for that exciting piece of news, Siri. As you can see, the days are quickly approaching! With pregnancy, the last few months seem to ache slowly by as you wait for the blessed relief of not being a giant hippo anymore and finally getting to see your baby. But this last “trimester” of our “normal life” seems to be running away from me. And with all that running, my to-do list seems to be getting longer! I like to think of my brain as a computer screen: tabs for each new thought. Let’s just say I may need to start opening up new windows because my tabs are getting quite numerous!!

Have you ever seen a squirrel preparing for winter? They instinctively know that the hardship of winter is approaching, so they spend every waking moment filling their treehouse full of nuts. They know that they will not have the ability to go out and gather food when the snow sets in. Well that is how I feel! I feel a small sense of panic has set into my brain. When can I close all these tabs?? I am feeling the need to accumulate more stuff in preparation for packing.



"Do I have enough moisturizer to last me a lifetime?"

"Should I go ahead and get an extra pair of leggings?"

"Should I save Percy’s new shirt for when we pack so it stays clean?"



It’s not as if Third World countries and any other country for that matter don’t have stores with make up, food and t shirts. But somehow I feel the urgency that I need to bring my entire life’s worth of stuff with me….in my one backpack! Just to let you know where my sense of crazy lies, here are a few things I have recently purchased to appease my ever growing list of tabs:



* [Rubber Rings](https://amzn.to/3nqmr0d) (Would if I lose my ring in the ocean?)
* Leggings. (I only have 3 pairs, so a 4th isn’t crazy, right?)
* Size 5 outfit for Percy ( He will grow into it by the summer.)
* 2 [Eyebrow pencils](https://amzn.to/3pTGOEA). (They are my favorite and Ulta won’t be everywhere….)



And in my Amazon cart is an [Essential Oil Traveling Case](https://amzn.to/2LoO9Nu) because I don’t want to live without my oils. (Or can I?)



While having our morning Bible study together, the children and I read Matthew 6.  I was struck with how silly, prideful and even sinful my heart has been towards my earthly possessions.  

<br/> 

**Matthew 6:25-34**

[](http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm)“Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [](http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm)Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [](http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-27.htm) And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?[](https://biblehub.com/esv/matthew/6.htm#footnotes) . And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [](http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-29.htm)yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [](http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-31.htm) Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ [](http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-32.htm)For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. [](http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-33.htm)But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. [](http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-34.htm) “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”



If God takes care of the birds around the world, why am I so concerned that I won’t be taken care of also? Jesus literally is reassuring the people that God will give you CLOTHES. Apparently I’m not the only one who has worried about finding clothing.



This has been very reassuring to me to know that God will watch out for us whether we are surrounded by familiar stores in the US or tiny boutiques in South America. Isn’t the patience of the Lord incredible? I know I am grateful!!
