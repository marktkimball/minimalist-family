Ahhh, I shall never tire of typing out 2021. It has SO much hope in those last two digits, unlike its previous year…..

Also, I shall never tire of Quiet Time.

Quiet Time. *noun*. “The time period during early afternoon hours, when all members of the household are required, begged, cajoled, bribed and by all means necessary, not allowed to speak for a blissful one hour period.  This originated during the Homeschooling Era when mothers needed a break from commanding, reprimanding, teaching and general talking. It proved to be a vital addition to their day, and has since become a tradition in most home-educating households to this day.”

I have 10 minutes left.

## Let’s talk school!!

<br/> <br/>

We are happily into our second week of our newest school routine/schedule. I recently uploaded my youtube video that explained my thoughts and process of books, curriculums and schedule that we are currently using. But for all my people out there who love a good paragraph to read on “real paper”, this post is for you:

Schedule for January - March of 2021

**9:30-10:15am.** (Kai goes down for his morning nap.) Morning Time. Bible study with *[My First Bible.](https://amzn.to/3i9bSxx)*

Verse memorization. (Matthew 6:10-15).

Hymns. (We find the original versions of hymns on Youtube with lyrics and sing along. We learned “[Church In The Wildwood](https://youtu.be/XFwG_fX3mmE)” this week).

Fun book to read aloud. This past week we read:* [Blueberry Sal.](https://amzn.to/39H02XF) [Owl Moon](https://amzn.to/2MYXlZI). [Katie and The Big Snow](https://amzn.to/2Xy1C8v)*. *[The Velveteen Rabbit](https://amzn.to/3slUudh)*.

**10:15- 10:30**. Percy has his quiet time with toys while I read to the girls the American Girl book, *Kit Saves The Day.* (You can still find these series on Ebay) We have been reading this entire series over the past 9 months and are almost through with all of the original books.

**10:30-11**. Curriculum book time with all 3 kids. Emmy is using the kindergarten book, *[Brain Quest K](https://amzn.to/2LuY8kH)*. McKenna is using first grade, *[Brain Quest 1](https://amzn.to/3shTeYN)*. Percy is happily scribbling in *[Big Preschool Book](https://amzn.to/3bz8o6b).* This is one room schoolhouse style, all sitting at the dining room table with me drinking my coffee while teaching each child from their own pages. Perfectly chaotic and wonderful at the same time!

**11:30-12**. Kai wakes up and the kids play outside while I take turns with the girls reading and doing Phonics with them. We are using the ancient Play’n Talk series books, [Bob Books](https://amzn.to/35AJzTD) and simple flashcards I made with letter combinations on them. “en, in, on, at, ag, ug, ou….etc.”

**12-12:30.** Maps and Spanish with everyone. For our geography, we use our [giant world map ](https://amzn.to/2LLsEXm)and our [USA map](https://amzn.to/38IKtzr) to find places we are reading about, where we live, missionaries we are praying for and general new countries. While I make lunch, the kids watch [Peppa Pig in Spanish](https://youtu.be/NaljHrhjO_I) on Youtube. (While they haven’t learned a ton of Spanish yet, they find it super interesting, and we use as many words throughout the day as we can!)

**12:30-2**. Lunch. Clean up. General play and shenanigans. Both boys go down for a nap.

**2:00-3:00**. Quiet Time. (See above definition to learn about this vital part to Mommy’s day)

**3:15-4ish**. Somewhere in here, I snuggle up with the girls and Percy after his nap to read another book. We are currently reading *[A Little Princess ](https://amzn.to/3oGsGOP)*and the girls are loving it!! I am hoping we will be able to watch the old Shirley Temple version when we are finished with it. Always read the books first!

After that, it is a free day for play, crafts, baking, walks, dinner, baths, and bed. Whew!

<br/> <br/> 

Our days are flowing by super smoothly!! With every hour spoken for, we never have a dull moment. After just finishing our first week of this schedule, I am very happy with it! Where we might get behind our routine about 15 minutes or so, we somehow make up the time before lunch. Everybody seems to be happy with it and I am happy to see them appreciating their free time to run outside. In Arizona, we are grateful for the sun and good weather in the winter!

I also mentioned in my Youtube video that Mark is reading *[The Little House on the Prairie](https://amzn.to/3bAKrv8)* series to the girls. This is the second time we have read them through these books and we just love them!

I haven’t had to change anything on the schedule yet, but if I will, I will let you know! This is keeping us nice and busy, which is helping us zoom towards our time of traveling in April! I am excited to see what school routine we will use when we are traveling and welcome the challenge.

Keep up with us on our Instagram where we keep you updated with new blogs posts, Youtube videos and news about our upcoming travels!!
