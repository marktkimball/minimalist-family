In this post, I will be sharing with you my Top Tips of how help your kids minimize and easily go through their stuff. It is hard, it is difficult, but it CAN BE DONE!!

When I asked 4 year old Emmy the other day if she wanted to help me organize some of her toys and treasures, she happily agreed, which is against her nature to want to purge anything!! 6 year old McKenna however, has happily been tossing her toys away with a quick “thank you” ever since she was 3. But Emmy? She is a born pack rat! She is the one who takes the toys out of the trash and saves everything!! From scrap pieces of a magazine to plastic baggies, Emmy deems everything worthy of saving as one of her treasures. So organizing and minimizing with her can usually mean a big ordeal, close to tears and nothing really getting “minimized” by the end.

However.

Since we have made the family decision to sell everything we own in order to full-time travel, the children have surprisingly, happily and quickly adapted to the idea that they won’t be able to bring everything with them in their backpack. Over the years, we have purged, splurged and purged again and again, only to always have more than we need or use. So this time, with the coming up launch from Arizona, we have to be more careful with our purchases. This time, when we minimize our toys, there isn’t anything coming in to replace them.

While minimizing with Emmy for our newest Youtube video, “[Minimalism with a 4 year old](https://youtu.be/MiPoxT_GhJU)”, I was so proud of Emmy’s attitude! She gleefully and carefully evaluated what toys brought her joy and quickly tossed away the excess. We made the rule that each girl can bring 1 doll, 1 stuffed animal and their blanket. But all the little tiny toys were hard to deal with, until I came up with a solution. Along with their [backpack](https://amzn.to/2LZXkE5) present for Christmas, I gave each girl a [clear, plastic zippered pouch](https://amzn.to/3qrB31c) to keep whatever tiny treasures they wanted. Each girl happily chose tiny Frozen figurines, shiny rocks, and whatever else they have stuffed in there.

While I haven’t purposely used any written rules with organizing with the children, I do seem to stick to a few methods that have worked really well for us!

SO LET’S DIVE IN!!

## Tips for Minimizing with Children

1. **Establish a Clear Goal.** Why are you wanting to organize? Is this for your sake or theirs? Do you need the space? Are you moving across the country? Is it to save money on storage in a moving truck? Is your home chaotic? Are they having a hard time keeping their room clean? Did another Christmas just happen so newer toys are more intriguing? Did you just watch the Marie Kondo show and get inspired?

Questions such as these are great to ask yourself as you are just starting out with the cleaning process. Before you throw anything away, it is necessary for you as the parent, to first have a CLEAR GOAL why you are minimizing in the first place.

2. **Explain Your Goal to Your Children**. Your goal may seem very clear to you because you have just finished your entire book, tv show or podcast that got you inspired for days, but this is the first time your children might be hearing about your new vision. As simply as you can, explain to them why you are wanting to establish change. Get them on board, and it will be so much easier through the entire organizing process.
3. **Respect Their Emotions, Wishes, and Comments**. If your Mom suddenly showed up at your door and began throwing away your Pottery Barn decorations into a trashcan, saying you didn’t need them anymore, you wouldn’t happily help out, would you? NO! You would be aghast and demand her to stop touching your stuff! In the same way, your children like their stuff. They like it a lot. I will say that again. Your. Children. Like. Their. Stuff. They are probably very happy with the way things are. So move slowly, respectfully and carefully as you begin handling their items. If possible with older kids, let them pull out all the items from the shelf, drawer or area that you are targeting. Handling it will let them know what items are there, and possibly surprise them by what is hiding back in the corner.
4. **Pick a Designated Small Area: Box/Bag, Drawer or Shelf**. In order to keep your things organized, designating a small storage bin or shelf will keep things in check. And when that area is full, stop. Nothing else gets added. Don’t pick a huge drawer for all the toys because the kids will happily point out to you that there is plenty of room for more toys. Pick a small container that is significantly smaller than their previous storage space.
5. **Go Through Each Item Individually**. Marie Kondo style, ask yourself questions for each item. Do you use it? Do you love it? Are you only keeping it because someone gave it to you? (If it was a gift, once you have thanked that kind person, they no longer have hold on the item. It is yours to deposit as you wish: be it drawer or trash can. No guilt here!) With the children, notice which item they light up for and which one they only grab because they are used to it being there.
6. **Start With Their Favorites.** Pick a few toys that are precious to them and assure them that you are definitely going to keep those. Put them in their designated Small Box. Once the child feels reassured that their favorites aren’t on the chopping block, they will relax to go through the toys that are left.
7. **Don’t Keep Duplicates**. 3 journals, 15 gel pens, 7 hair clips, 9 toy cars. These are the types of toys that keep your child from being happy with fewer items. Just as it is overwhelming for a child to see a heaped-up plate of food in front of them, too many choices of toys to play with, makes their imagination go stagnant. Help them out by quickly picking one of their favorites from each category.
8. **Eliminate Baby Toys**. If your child is older than 1, they have outgrown all baby rattles, soft books, teethers, and many other “baby” specific toys. Honestly, most babies would rather play with a cardboard box than a specific rattle. While the older child may be used to seeing those toys in their room, they are definitely too hold to play with a teether toy. Those can quickly be thanked and move on their way.
9. **Remind Them of Your Goal and Their Favorites.** At some point during the eliminating process, your child may start to panic that you are going to throw their bed in the trash next! Kindly remind them that you are keeping their favorites, and you are only helping them find all their favorite toys. Remind them of your new family goal that you decided together at the beginning.
10. **Let them be “in charge”.** But YOU are really in charge. Remember, you are the parent and have final veto power. If they are struggling with the decision to keep the old magazine or not, gently remind them that they already read it, enjoyed it and can look forward to another magazine in the mail next month.
11. **Thank Each Item**. Marie Kondo really knows what she is talking about when she instructs you to thank each item before letting it go. Knowing all the emotions that are connected with each item, it can be devastating to simply toss it away in the trash. Your children may have held onto this particular thing for years. It could even be older than their baby brother! But when you can acknowledge the good things that came out of the item, it is a guilt-free trip to the trashcan or Goodwill pile after you are able to talk to the item. Some of the phrases we like to use are, “Thank you for your service. All done”. “Well, I had fun using you, but I don’t need to use you anymore”. “You were good for a while but I’m all done.” The kids love this and happily talk to their stuff. It really helps them in the giving-up process and makes it seem less cruel to toss away their beloved old slippers.
12. **Be Positive.** Using words that help the child feel that they are in charge of the cleaning process empowers them in a confident way. It encourages your child to continue to make the difficult decision of keeping or throwing away the map from the zoo. “You are making such good decisions!” “Look at how much you have gone through already!” “Look at your box full of your favorite toys!” “We are almost done!” “Thank you for letting me help you organize today!” “This is fun!”
13. **Be The Example.** I know this post is about helping children organize but if they haven’t ever seen you go through your own stuff, they will never understand why they need to go through theirs. Let them help you go through the junk drawer, your sock drawer or even your kitchen spices. Let them see you make each decision clearly, happily and firmly, bringing your own satisfaction with each clean shelf. Once they understand the process, they are going to be much more excited to try it on their own stuff.
14. **Have fun!** Minimizing won’t happen overnight. Everything takes time. But even if you are only able to minimize a few toys, starting small is better than not starting at all! Play music, make sure everyone is well fed, and keep the area you are purging small and manageable. Everybody, adults and children alike, get tired of cleaning after a while so don’t drag this into hours of purging. When their attention and energy starts to wane, try to be sensitive and wrap it up.

I am proud of you for wanting what is best for your children!! You can do it!!
