Brekkie.  Breakfast.  Our favorite meal of the day!! 

Did you know that when we move to Puerto Rico I won't have an oven in our Air B&B?  Which means I won't be able to make our most favorite meal everrrr:  Granola!

But in the meantime we will continue to have our granola recipe for breakfast, lunch, dinner and (my personal favorite) evening snack.

<br/> 

I invented this recipe when we found out our 2nd daughter, Emmy, was allergic to nuts.  It was super sad we couldn't eat nuts anymore but at least she was able to enjoy this cereal that wasn't topped with almonds.  

Using seeds and the fun addition of plain cheerios gives this granola such a unique crunch that most granolas don't even know about!    

To watch a step-by-step video of me making this recipe, head over to our Youtube channel and check it out!

For a **GLUTEN-FREE** option, just use GF Oats and omit the cheerios.
