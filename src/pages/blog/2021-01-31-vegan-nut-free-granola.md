Brekkie.  Breakfast.  Our favorite meal of the day.  

Did you know that when we move to Puerto Rico I won't have an oven in our Air B&B?  Which means I won't be able to make our most favorite meal everrrr:  Granola!

But in the meantime we will continue to have our granola recipe for breakfast, lunch, dinner and (my personal favorite) evening snack.  

I invented this recipe when we found out our 2nd daughter, Emmy, was allergic to nuts.  Talking about allergies would be another story, but at least she was able to enjoy this cereal that wasn't topped with almonds.  

Using seeds and the fun addition of plain cheerios gives this granola such a unique crunch that most granolas don't even know about!    

To watch Percy and I make this recipe, head over to our Youtube channel and check it out!
