      There are lots of ways for you to join in on one of our services. With multiple service times throughout the week, we want you to have as much of an opportunity as possible to be a part. On Sundays, we have our morning worship service at 11am. Prior to the service, there is a Bible study hour beginning at 10am. The Sunday evening service begins at 6pm. We also have a midweek Bible study on Wednesdays at 7pm.

      Our address is: 6526 Guinea Pike, Loveland, Ohio 45140. We have a main entrance at the front of the building that takes you straight into the main auditorium. There are greeters available to answer any questions you might have. Feel free to say good morning, take a bulletin, and have a seat. If you are coming for a Sunday School class, ask a greeter where the class is taking place and they will help you along. If you don't know what class to go to, no worries, come into the main auditorium and have a seat for our Pastor’s Bible study. You will be filled with the Word!

      We encourage everyone to bring their Bibles and follow along with the Pastor’s message. If you do not have a Bible, we will provide one on request.

    lead: How should I dress?

      At Branch Hill Baptist Church, we want you to come in modest attire. Our ministry leaders and many in our church family dress in more traditional “Sunday” dress; however, our main goal is that you would feel welcome and comfortable on your visit.

    lead: Do you have a nursery?
    text: >
      We do have a nursery available for children up to age 2. The nursery is highly staffed and available for Sunday Bible classes and the main service. There is no nursery available on Sunday evening or Wednesday evening. If you wish to keep your child with you during the service, please feel free to do so. There is a foyer area should you need to sneak out for a moment for any reason with your little ones.

At Branch Hill Baptist Church we want to make sure our guests feel welcome and know what to expect when they walk through our doors. We know there may be many questions you have such as, which door do I come in, is there a nursery for all services, what kind of music can I expect? Let us take a couple moments and fill you in so you can feel completely at ease when you enter our church home.
