### Auditorium Class

Pastor Greer teaches the Auditorium Class each Sunday at 10am and incorporates a study of the Bible book by book. In this way, the class seeks to gain a greater understanding of the Bible as it is written. Often today, churches focus on independent verses or portions of scripture in their teaching. Although there is nothing wrong with this, if this method is used exclusively, it creates “holes” and “gaps” in our understanding. Although there are no age requirements for this class, it typically ministers to both single and married adults. If you choose to visit, be sure to bring your Bible and a note pad with pen...oh, and a healthy dose of curiosity.

### Foundations Class

In the Foundations class our purpose is to teach the word of God in a doctrinal, spiritual and practical way that it may lay a firm foundation in Christ that is solid, secure and unmovable. Focusing on individuals who are ages 18 and up, our desire is to see growth in the life of the believer and to build our lives in a way that we may bring glory and honor to God.

### GEMS Class

The God's Elite Militia Serving (GEMS) class is composed of members age 60 and up. The purpose of this class is to teach the truths of the Bible. In spite of our aches and pains, we try to be an encouragement to others. The GEMS are like a militia standing with their whole armor on, contending for the faith. Their greatest weapon is, as it says in Ephesians 6:18 “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.”

### BHBC Teen Class

The BHBC Teen class is designed to teach Christian teens the practical application of God’s Word in everyday life through example, scriptural principals, sound doctrine, and submission to God and His Holy Spirit. Our goal is to prepare teens to participate in outreach by providing training and opportunities to reach the lost in their neighborhoods, schools, families, and abroad. Our desire for these Christian teens is for them to become spiritually mature for the next step in their lives both as young adults and active church members.

### Ages 8-12 Class

Our goal for the 8-12 class is to prepare the young person for the challenges of their teen years by combining biblical and historical knowledge with practical spiritual application. The class begins with a brief survey of the Old Testament, paying close attention to the history of Israel. Periodically, we dedicate special times for teaching the boys and girls how to be a witness and to present the gospel to their peers. We also highlight different characters from our nation’s history along with several of our missionaries. The purpose of the class is to educate children on the Christian heritage of our nation that is no longer being taught in public education; another goal is to spotlight the character traits that made these men and women great.

### King’s Kids

In the King’s Kids class the children ages 4-7 are taught Bible lessons and character traits through biblical illustrations. Because we believe that Bible memorization is very important, we encourage the children to learn a verse each week. During those three years the children will have learned 156 verses and the books of the Bible. We also enjoy crafts and coloring pages with each lesson. Our desire is to take a special interest in each child on a personal level, so they know they are an important part of the class.
